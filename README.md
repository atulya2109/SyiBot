# SyiBot
An *Open Source Spotify Music* Bot For Discord. There are many Discord bots out there in the wild that can play music from Youtube. But are there any that can play your songs from your **Spotify Playlist** for you? I couldn't find one, so here's my own implementation.

## How Does It Work?
**Syibot** works by fetching the songs on any public Spotify playlist by quering the Spotify API and then generating a stream by finding that song on Youtube.

## Commands
The bot is still in its early development stages and is quite buggy. There are many known bugs and many that are yet to surface, making it pretty unstable. Here are some commands that work.

### !play
#### Usage 
`!play <song-name>`

### !spotify
#### Usage
`!spotify <playlist-uri>`
